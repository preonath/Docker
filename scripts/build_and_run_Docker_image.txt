Step 1: Write the Python and Bash Scripts
You created two scripts that output "Hello World":
	hello.py (Python Script):
	print("Hello World")
	
	
	hello.sh (Bash Script):
	#!/bin/bash
	echo "Hello World"

Step 2: Write the Dockerfile
You wrote a Dockerfile that specifies how to build the Docker image:
	Dockerfile
	# Use an official Python runtime as the parent image
	FROM python:3.8-slim

	# Set the working directory in the container to /app
	WORKDIR /app

	# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
	COPY . /app

	# Define the command to run when the container starts
	CMD ["python", "hello.py"]


Step 3: Build the Docker Image
You then built the Docker image with the following command:
	# docker build: Tells Docker to build an image.
	# -t hello-world-app: Tags the image with the name "hello-world-app".
	# .: Tells Docker to use the Dockerfile in the current directory.
	


	
Step 4: Fix Dockerfile Naming Issue
	#You had an issue where your Dockerfile was named with a space in front, and Docker could not find it. You fixed the naming with:
	mv ' Dockerfile' Dockerfile


Step 5: Run the Docker Container
	# To run the Python script, you would execute:
	docker run hello-world-app

	# To run the Bash script instead, you would execute:
	docker run --rm hello-world-app /bin/bash hello.sh
